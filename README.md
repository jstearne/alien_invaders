# alien_invaders
A practice game using Pygame, Python

Use Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes

I made a Javascript version without knowing what I was doing.
May as well try to do it better with Python since I know it better and have instructions!


# Update with scoring, then use as a template for my own game!

Run game by entering

`$ python3 alien_invasion.py `

Requires pygame 2.1.2
